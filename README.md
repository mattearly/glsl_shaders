# glsl_shaders

This is not a standalone runnable project, rather just a collection.  Basically a collection of shaders I use/have used.

The primary goal of this repo is that I don't lose or misplace old shaders that I *once used somewhere*

## A Note On Sources

A lot of these come partially from [learnopengl](https://learnopengl.com/). But have probably been modified slightly or sometimes greatly to my liking/use. I'll try to mention other sources as they come up.

The ubershader in particually is my own cobbled creation, combining multiple other shaders and techniques.
